# My Landing Page
Applied some cool animations to make the landing page template more modular.

Used AOS library animations which is quick and easy to use.

Feel free to **fork/clone** and modify it according to your own needs.

**ENJOY** my version here: [MY LANDING PAGE](https://the-localhost.github.io/animated-landing-page/)
